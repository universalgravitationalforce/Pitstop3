The dataset is structured as a CSV file where each row represents
one electronic literature work.

The selected columns describe:
 1. Core identification
- id 
- title
- creator
- year 
- url
- access_date
- publication context
- formal characteristics
- access information
2. Form and medium

5. Short description

These fields were chosen to allow comparison across works while
remaining simple and consistent.

**Known limitations/biases** 

I'm focusing on e-lit that is more contemporary, game-driven, easy to read, with creators from similar cultural background.
