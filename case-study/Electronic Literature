B1. Object description (digital literary object)
what it is, where it lives, how it is accessed
what counts as “the text” (and what doesn’t)
B2. Textual model & medium
linear/non-linear, modularity, interactivity
what the interface does to reading
B3. Narratology
narrator / narrative voice
narrative time (order, duration, frequency)
focalization
segmentation / pacing (screens, nodes, paths, episodes)
If narratology doesn’t fit well, say why (that’s acceptable, but must be argued).
B4. Quantitative glimpse (optional, not required)
If feasible, include a small quantitative observation only if you can extract text responsibly.
If it’s not feasible, briefly explain the constraint (e.g., heavy multimedia, interaction-dependent text, access
limits).
B5. Reflection
what this object makes possible (affordances)
what it makes difficult (limits)
what would be lost if treated like a print text
